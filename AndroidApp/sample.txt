my app acts as a face attendance formte.but my idea is totally different.if the user download the app and login in that and add the necessart details and choose the app ,then set the timer for the each one.if the user opent he app ,faceguard detect their face for the first time in the background and start the timer for that app .also add the 4 digit pin for the login after create the account .
